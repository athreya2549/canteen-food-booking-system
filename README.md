# canteen-food-booking-system
The primary goal of the Canteen Food Booking System is to streamline the food ordering process for students, enabling them to easily view, order, and pay for food online. Simultaneously, it allows canteen owners to manage inventory and orders efficiently, generate accurate bills, and handle cancellations and refunds effectively.
